Null Object Pattern Definition - Defining an object of a class that implements required methods, but without any behavior

Simplified - "Create Nothing Behavior"

Why do we want to use it?
Prevents needless null checking, ensures our code will not break in instances where there shouldn't be a thing

Common Examples
No input, no powerup, no target, no weapon equipped, etc.
