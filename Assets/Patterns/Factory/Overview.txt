Factory Pattern Definition
Creational pattern that uses factory methods to create objects without
having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

Simplified - "Create new objects without knowing concrete type"

Why do we want to use it?
We want to be able to create general 'types' of things at runtime, rather than very specific things

Common Examples
Spawning systems, Loot spawning, Procedural generation
