Command Pattern Definition
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting us parameterize other
objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations

Simplified - "Wrap a method call into an object"

Why do we want to use it?
We may need to track method calls or actions for use in our systems. For example, 'Undo or Redo'

Common Examples
RTS commands, Any application that tracks Action history, Undoing actions in a turn-based game
