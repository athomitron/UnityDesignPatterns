Example - SearchBot
This example will explore the State Pattern and how you can use it for game objects.
The State Pattern uses a 'Finite State Machine' to store possible states and handle the transitions
on how we can move from one state to the next. We can constrain states to a particular object so that
it behaves differently depending on what's happening inside of the game.
Most commonly, you will see this used to define the major 'phases' in a game... for example, "Enemy Turn",
"Player Select", "Equipment Screen", etc.
We'll look at how to use states on a specific object in this example, but know that you can add states
to almost any object you want.

SearchBot States
In our scene we will have a SearchBot that has 2 primary types of classes:
SearchBotSM - This is the SearchBot's State Machine, and it holds all the possible states
Searchbot States:
SearchBotIdleState - This State defines SearchBot behaviour while in Idle state
SearchBotSearchState - This State defines Searchbot behaviour while in Searching state
SearchBotFoundState - This State defines SearchBot behaviour while in Found state
The State Pattern is fairly complex, but as long as you're defining the 'state' an object is in based on
conditionals, then you're using a variant of it. For our example, each State needs to implement:
Enter - gets called when the state is entered. Use this to set up your state
Tick - this simulates Update() ticks during the state
FixedTick - this simulates FixedUpdate() ticks during the state
Exit - gets called when the state is transitioning out, to a new state. Use this to unhook or revert anything
that you might have changed when the state was entered.
Press Play and click around the scene. We have a TargetAssigner gameObject that processes mouse click targets,
and the SearchBot responds to them according to the state. If we're in Idle state, we transition to Searching and
move towards the target. If we're searching, and we reach the target, we transition to found state. After a brief
delay, we transition back to Idle. Click around in Play mode to test this out.
