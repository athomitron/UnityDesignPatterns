State Pattern Definition
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear
to change its class

Simplified - "Object changes behavior based on game state"

Why do we want to use it?
We want different behavior depending on various gameplay input or parameters. For example, we
may want the game to act differently in the 'Combat' phase than the 'Exploration' phase
