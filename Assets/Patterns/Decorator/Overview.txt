Decorator Pattern Definition
Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically,
without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Simplified - "Add this behavior on top of that one"

Why do we want to use it?
We may want stackable behavior between classes, without creating new classes

Common Examples
Stat Modifiers, buffs/debuffs, elemental systems
