Object Pool Pattern Definition
Improve performance and memory use by reusing objects from a
fixed pool instead of allocating and freeing them individually

Simplified - "Reuse objects instead of Destroying them"

Why do we want to use it?
To prevent unpredictable optimization issues from the Garbage Collector from excessive Creation and Destruction
of objects at runtime

Common Examples
Bullet systems, armies of units, particle effects
